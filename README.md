# JMH Visualizer

Visualize [JMH](http://openjdk.java.net/projects/code-tools/jmh/) Benchmarks! Online version at http://jmh.morethan.io!

## Features

- Vizualize the benchmarks of a single JSON result grouped by benchmark class
  - Vertical bar-chart with score and score error 
  - Link to the original JSON
  - Show individual runs as tooltip
- Compare the benchmarks of 2 runs (two JSON files) grouped by benchmark class
  - Vertical bar-chart from -100% to 100%
  - Link to the original JSON
  - Show score and error of both runs in tooltip
- Visualize secondary metrics like 'Â·gc.alloc.rate'

## Major Changes

- **May 2017** - 0.4 Secondary Metrics support
- **Apr 2017** - 0.3 Error Bars & Params support
- **Nov 2016** - 0.2: Add 2 run compare view
- **Okt 2016** - 0.1: Initial Release

## Tips & Tricks

While this app will visualize any valid JMH JSON you throw at it, you can write your benchmarks in a way that make the visualization much more enjoyable...

- Put those benchmarks in a single class which you most likely wanne compare to each other
- Don't mix incompatible benchmark styles into one class (like mixing average and single shot is ok, but mixing avarage and throughput will screw up the chart)
- On the other hand, don't put to much stuff in a single class/chart (since readability will suffer) - deconstruct
- Sensibly design your package structure, your class name and you methods names, those are reflected in the auto-generated charts
- Keep method names short but meaningful
- The method names reflect initial sort, so if you have benchmarks called 'with1Threads, with10Threads' naming them 'with01Thread, with10Thread' will display nicer
